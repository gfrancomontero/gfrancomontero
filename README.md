Hola! It's Gonzalo Franco 👋

_(if you're wondering how to create a neat little intro like this one for your GitHub profile — it's quite easy. Create a new repo, name it to match your username, initialize it with a readme.md file, add content using markdown language, commit your changes, and off you go._ 😉

I'm an experienced software engineer and founder of OpenBroker, with a focus on JavaScript and Ruby development. With over 6 years of experience, I've crafted my skills in writing high-quality, scalable, and performant code. I'm passionate about best practices, technical writing, and clear documentation, always paying close attention to detail and accuracy.
